### Integrated Terminal

VS Code has an [integrated terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/master/docs/editor/integrated-terminal.md) which you can use to run shell commands. You can run Node.js directly from there and avoid switching out of VS Code while running command line tools.

**View** > **Integrated Terminal** (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal)` with the backtick character) will open the integrated terminal and you can run `node app.js` there:

For this walkthrough, you can use either an external terminal or the VS Code integrated terminal for running the command line tools.
